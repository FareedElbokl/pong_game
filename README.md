# pong_game
The original "pong" game recreated with python.

# Description
This project consists of a re-creation of the well known Pong game through python. The score is displayed at the top of the screen and automatically changes when a
point is earned. The right paddle is controlled by the arrows on the keyboard while the left paddle is controlled by the w, s, a, and d keys. After each 
point is acheived the ball re-centers itself in the middle and the game continues from there.

# Technologies
Python and object oriented programming were used.

# Install/Use
Run the code in a python-supported IDE.
